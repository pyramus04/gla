Description:

Our goal is to offer a comprehensive digital library that empowers users to discover new and related games tailored to their preferences. Our app features an extensive collection of video games, giving users the ability to explore consoles, compatibility, cross-gen availability, and online multiplayer options for their desired game. We aim to simplify searching for video games, eliminating the need for users to spend countless hours scrolling through game stores or GameStop. Our app is designed for individuals seeking fresh and enjoyable gaming experiences beyond the same three games they typically play, and who want something new for a change. Users can create accounts, browse games, and leave reviews, while publishers are responsible for publishing their games with descriptions and necessary details.
